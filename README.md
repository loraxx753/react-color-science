# React Color Science

A React Component Library that can display a wide array of information about colors.

## Get Started

Clone repository, install dependencies, and start the app with one line: `git clone git@github.com:loraxx753/react-color-science.git && cd react-color-science && npm i && npm run start`

## Documentation

This app uses [Styleguideist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) for documentation, do whatever you'd like from their documentation, and run `npm run styleguide` to get a styleguideist styleguide at [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060).

(There's not really much there right now...fyi)

## Building for Production

This app also includes [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) in its devDependencies. The easiest way to deploy a production version is to run `npm run deploy` and follow the instructions in the cli.

You can use [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) as a [free](https://surge.sh/help/why-is-surge-free) production host by [remembering the domain name](http://surge.sh/help/remembering-a-domain) or by using your own [unique custom domain](http://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain).
